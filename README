Description
===========
Diurnal is a program for parsing Google sheets schedule data and forwarding
entries to a Dart frontend.

It is intended to be run continuously as a daemon on a (possibly low-resource)
server. It maintains an internal queue of messages/entries to be forwarded at
specified times, and fetches updates to this queue from a remote source of
ground truth at a configurable, infrequent interval.


Specification
=============
- Fetches data from Google sheet.
- Sends scheduled blocks to a Dart frontend.
    - Sends:
        - Title
        - Weight
        - Minutes
        - Start time (in case frontend loses connection)
- Receives actual blocks from frontend (serves as completion data).
- Updates Gooogle sheet with received data.
- Set timezone.


Won't fix
=========
- No support for adding/editing/deleting scheduled blocks from frontend.
- No support for recording actual blocks with an endtime in the future.


Undecided
=========
Should data flowing frontend -> backend be free-form text, or options selected
from a predefined list? The first allows more expressivity, and therefore a
possibly better record of activities, but the second makes the data entry
process shorter, which is paramount.

Should the user be able to edit past actual block data? Yes, this should be as
accurate as possible, and allowing revisions is important.


Maybe
=====
- Cache recent actual block title entries as buttons (McKade).
