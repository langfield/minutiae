Description
===========
Diurnal is a program for parsing Google sheets schedule data and forwarding
entries to a Dart frontend.

It is intended to be run continuously as a daemon on a (possibly low-resource)
server. It maintains an internal queue of messages/entries to be forwarded at
specified times, and fetches updates to this queue from a remote source of
ground truth at a configurable, infrequent interval.


Specification
=============
1.  Fetches data from Google sheet.
2.  Sends scheduled blocks to a Dart frontend.
3.  Receives completion data and actual blocks from frontend.
4.  Updates Gooogle sheet with received data.
